# TinkerBot-Arm: 5-DOF Robotic Arm Simulation

This project showcases a 3D model of a 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm designed using Tinkercad. It serves as a simple educational prototype for understanding the mechanics and structure of articulated robotic arms commonly used in automation, pick-and-place systems, and robotics learning environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF):
  - Rotating base
  - Shoulder joint (pitch)
  - Elbow joint (pitch)
  - Wrist joint (pitch or roll)
  - Functional gripper (open/close)
- Designed using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/)
- Easy to customize and extend for further simulation or prototyping
