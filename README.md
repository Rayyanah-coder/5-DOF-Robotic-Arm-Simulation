# TinkerBot-Arm: 5-DOF Robotic Arm Simulation

This project showcases a 3D model of a 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm designed using Tinkercad. It serves as a simple educational prototype for understanding the mechanics and structure of articulated robotic arms commonly used in automation, pick-and-place systems, and robotics learning environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF):
  - Rotating base
  - Shoulder joint (pitch)
  - Elbow joint (pitch)
  - Wrist joint (pitch or roll)
  - Functional gripper (open/close)
- Designed using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/)
- Easy to customize and extend for further simulation or prototyping

## üì∑ Preview



## üìö Use Cases

- Robotics education and demonstrations
- Simulating joint movement planning
- Prototyping designs for Arduino-controlled robotic arms

## üß† Future Ideas
- better design
- Add servo motor mounts for physical build.
- Simulate movement using Arduino and Tinkercad Circuits.
- Extend to 6-DOF for greater flexibility.
